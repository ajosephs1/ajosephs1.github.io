              <h3> Here's a timeline of the fashion Moguls' life...</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>1944</strong> - Dan was born in Harlem, New York, and grew up on 129th and Lexington Avenue with three brothers and three sisters. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>1960's</strong> - Dan worked for a Harlem newspaper called Forty Acres and a Mule. He eventually became a vegetarian and gave up drinking, smoking and drugs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>1968–74</strong> - he toured Africa as part of a program from Columbia University and the Urban League.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>1974</strong> - he decided to be a clothier, and first sold shoplifted items out of his car.
                </li>
                <li>
                   <strong>1982</strong> - Dapper Dan's Boutique opened, located on 125th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues and at times was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Dan's trademark was his bold usage of logos from high-end luxury brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Fendi.
                </li>
                <li>
                   <strong>1985</strong> - Day ventured into hip hop fashion, when he first styled LL Cool J, and Day has since been associated with hip-hop royalty.He  created looks for The Fat Boys, Jam Master Jay and Big Daddy Kane, as well as sports stars such as boxers Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather, and athlete Diane Dixon. Day's illegal use of logos in his custom-made designs led to counterfeiting raids and litigation, and ultimately the demise of his first store.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>1988</strong> - Tyson got into a brawl with Mitch Green outside his store, which put Dapper Dan's in the media spotlight for the first time. After Tyson was photographed wearing a "knock off" Fendi jacket from Dapper Dan — which was referred to as "an all-night clothing store that caters to performers" in The New York Times — interest in the store eventually brought his usage of European luxury fashion logos to the attention of the European luxury companies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>1992</strong> - After legal action by Fendi and then-U.S. Attorney Sonia Sotomayor, Dapper Dan's was shut down for good. He was shunned by the mainstream fashion world for decades, though he continued to work "underground" as a designer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2017</strong> - Gucci's creative director Alessandro Michele designed a jacket based on a well-known Dapper Dan design for Diane Dixon in 1989. Many believed that Gucci had stolen the Dapper Dan design, especially due to Gucci not stating it to be a homage until after they drew criticism. With the support of Michele and Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri, Day and the Italian brand partnered for a line of men's wear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2018</strong> - Day opened a new atelier on Lenox Avenue in partnership with Gucci, Dapper Dan of Harlem, the first luxury house fashion store in Harlem.
